# CreepyAI Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements and long‑term goals for
CreepyAI. It serves as a guide for contributors and stakeholders to
understand the direction of the project.

## Short‑term goals

* **Advanced correlation analysis** — Build tools to correlate
  geolocation data across multiple data sources and identify patterns.
* **Machine learning integration** — Explore simple ML models to
  cluster and classify location traces to aid investigations.
* **Timeline and graph visualisation** — Develop UI components for
  interactive timelines and network graphs.
* **Batch processing** — Provide CLI or GUI options to process large
  numbers of datasets in a single operation.

## Medium‑term goals

* **Plugin marketplace** — Define a registry for third‑party plugins and
  standardise metadata for discovery.
* **Reporting framework** — Generate PDF or HTML reports summarising
  findings and statistics.
* **Internationalisation (i18n)** — Introduce translation support to
  make the application accessible to non‑English speakers.

## Long‑term goals

* **Integration with external OSINT tools** — Provide bridges to
  incorporate data from other open‑source tools and intelligence
  platforms.
* **Real‑time streaming** — Support ingestion of live data feeds and
  real‑time visualisation.
* **Machine learning research** — Investigate advanced models and
  techniques for predictive analytics and anomaly detection.
