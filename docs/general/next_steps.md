# Next Steps for CreepyAI

Your PyQt5 installation is now working correctly! Here are some next steps to continue with your CreepyAI project:

## 1. Test the UI Components

Run the UI test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_ui.py
```

To test the WebEngine component (for maps and web content):

```bash
python test_ui.py --webengine
```

## 2. Run the Main Application

Use the launcher script to run the main application:

```bash
./launch_macos.sh
```

## 3. Project Structure Setup

The project template folder (`project_template/`) contains a basic configuration for new projects. You can modify this template to suit your specific needs.

## 4. Development Tasks

Here are some suggested development tasks to focus on:

- [ ] Create the main application window and UI layout
- [ ] Implement project creation/loading functionality
- [ ] Set up the plugin system
- [ ] Create data visualization components
- [ ] Implement reporting features

## 5. Documentation

Consider documenting your code as you develop:

```bash
python build_creepyai.py --docs
```

## 6. Testing

Create unit tests for critical components:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 7. Build a Package

When you're ready to distribute:

```bash
python build_creepyai.py --package
```
